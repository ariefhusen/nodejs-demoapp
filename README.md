# Node.js - Demo Web Application

This is a simple Node.js web app using the Express framework and EJS templates.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

# Deployment on Server


### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - for running as a container, or building images


Clone the project to any directory where you do development work
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariefhusen/nodejs-demoapp.git
```
